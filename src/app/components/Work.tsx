      description: 'Throughout my career with the City of McAllen, I was able to gain experience in working in the different fields that make up IT such as networking, cyber security, support, telecommunications, and programming. I effectively educated users about the risks associated with phishing emails by deploying a phishing awareness campaign. When assisting in viewing the firewall, I was able to help determine if certain email addresses or ip addresses needed to be blacklisted or whitelisted. In the case of a compromised system, I learned the companyâ€™s response plan as well as created a detailed report about what cause the system to become compromised. Additionally, I actively participated in cyber security awareness trainings, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong security practices. Leveraging my technical expertise, I efficiently resolved network connectivity issues by splicing a deteriorating CAT5 cables. Troubleshooting technical problems for end users as well as setting up desktop devices we another key aspect of my role. I was successfully able to not only replace, but configure Cisco phones, facilitating a smooth phone upgrade process for employees. Furthermore, I utilized the KACE Systems Deployment Appliance to reimagine laptops when needed. My contributions in these areas reflect my commitment to a career in the IT field as well as my ability to effectively address diverse challenges in a dynamic environment.',

      description: "During my involvement in the rover development project, I played a key role in multiple areas of the project's advancement. I actively contributed to the programming of the rover using a Raspberry Pi and Python, leveraging my technical skills to ensure its smooth operation. Additionally, I conducted comprehensive research on various LIDAR cameras and sensors to identify the most suitable options for mapping the rover's path. By evaluating their capabilities and performance, I provided valuable insights to optimize the rover's mapping capabilities. Another significant contribution was my research on sealant development. I explored different techniques to create a specialized sealant capable of patching an 18-inch diameter hole while remaining removable when necessary. Through my research and analysis, I identified a balance between the sealant's strength and its ease of removal, ensuring its effectiveness in sealing the hole. These experiences demonstrate my technical proficiency, problem-solving abilities, and dedication to contributing to innovative projects."
